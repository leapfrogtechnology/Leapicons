First off, thank you for considering contributing to Leapicons.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Leapicons is an open source project and contributions are always welcomed. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests which can be incorporated into Leapicons itself.

# Ground Rules

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Leapicons [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/leapfrogtechnology/Leapicons/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to `opensource@lftechnology.com`.

# Pull Requests

Please create a Pull Request for any new icons and bug fixes. Please follow the following guidelines for creating a PR:

## Your First Contribution?

Unsure where to begin contributing to Leapicons? You can start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/leapfrogtechnology/Leapicons/issues/).

Here are a couple of useful links: [Make a pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [First timer only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

## Branching:

1. __Always make a branch from the dev branch__. Work on a new branch created from the dev branch. Never create branch from the master and always send a *pull request* to the dev branch.
2. __Name branch appropriately__. Name your branches with the related category your icons fall under. For example if creating Weather icons; the branch would be named *weather*.

## Guidelines for pull requests:

1. __Make your commit messages as descriptive as possible.__ Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that needs to be focused in detail.
2. __Document your pull request__. Explain your fix, link to the relevant issue, add screenshots when adding new icons.
3. __Include only related work__. If your pull request has unrelated commit, it won't be accepted.

# Requesting a new Icon

Before creating an icon request, please search to see if someone has requested the icon already. If there is an open request, please add a :+1:.

If the icon has not already been requested, [create an issue](https://github.com/leapfrogtechnology/Leapicons/issues/new) with a title of `Icon request: <icon name>` and add as much information as possible.

# Getting started

For something that is bigger fix:
1. Create your own fork of the repo
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/leapfrogtechnology/Leapicons/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
    * Send a pull request.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
As a rule of thumb, small changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another.

# Bug Reports

Before reporting an issue, please search to see if someone has filed a similar issue before. If there is already an open issue, please add a :+1: and/or leave a comment with additional information.

When creating a new issue make sure to include the following:
- Version of Leapicons in use. Are you running from source/master? Are you using a released build? Which release?
- Your environment. What is your operating system? Your Illustrator version?
- A screenshot of any visual bug.
